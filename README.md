# NLP Projects Repository

Welcome to the NLP Projects Repository! This repository houses various Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, showcasing applications, models, and techniques in the field of NLP. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore NLP concepts or an experienced practitioner seeking inspiration, this repository has something for you.

## About

This repository is a collection of NLP projects developed using various libraries, frameworks, and datasets. Each project is aimed at addressing different aspects of natural language processing, including but not limited to:

- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Text generation
- Machine translation
- Question-Answering systems
- And more!

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each containing a separate NLP project. Inside each project directory, you'll find:

1. **README.md**: A detailed description of the project, including its objectives, methodologies, and results.
2. **Code**: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks containing the code for the project.
3. **Datasets**: Datasets used for training and evaluation purposes.
4. **Project Report**: Summary of the results.
